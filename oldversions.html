PHYLIP has been distributed since October of 1980, when version 1.0 was
released.  Early versions differed mostly by minor bug fixes, but as time
went on more and more changes were included in each release.
<P>
Many older versions of PHYLIP are available from our server.
These were
in Pascal, and what you will find there is the Pascal source code and
the documentation files.  (At a later date I may also release the
compiled executables for some of these versions.)
<P>
<P>
<H2>Extracting the archives</H2>
<P>
They are in the form of Unix tar archives, which can be un-tar'ed on
any Unix server, but putting them in a directory of their own and then
issuing the command<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>tar xvf phylip17.tar</CODE><BR>
(or whatever the archive name is).
<P>
The <code>tar</code> command will also work in a Command Tool window on Windows
10, and in a Terminal window on Mac OS.  These are found, respectively, in the
Accessories menu and in the Utilities subfolder in the Applications folder.  You might need to omit the "v" switch
and use a "-" to designate the switches, as in the command<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>tar -xf phylip17.tar</CODE><BR>
<P>
<P>
<H2>Compiling the programs</H2>
<P>
You should be able to get the programs to execute
by compiling then with Gnu Pascal or with Free Pascal.
Some attention may be needed to the RESET and
REWRITE statements (and associated ATTACH statements
that are needed with them or instead of them).
That may include specifying input and output file
names in those statements.
<P>

<P>
More are coming.  Version 1.7 is the earliest one that I have.  Version
1.0 was released in October, 1980.  A reading of the "bugs" file in version
1.7 will show that only a few bug fixes and minor features separate
versions 1.0 and 1.7.
<P>
These programs are, of course, primitive compared to later programs.
They are presented here primarily for their historical interest.

<H2>Version 3.5c</H2>
<P>
Although the official version now being distributed is 3.6, the previous
version, 3.5c, was so widely used that it may be useful to continue to have it
available here.

Macintosh Mac OS executables are also available
for Apple Macintosh systems
running Mac OS 8 or Mac OS 9 (we don't know whether they will work on
Mac OS 7). They will not work on pre-PowerMac 680x0 Macintosh systems.
These are available for version 3.65 and have not been updated
since then.  Almost nobody has these operating systems anymore -- they were long
ago superseded by MacOS X (which has recently been renamed MacOS but
is not these old operating systems.
<P>
<font color=red>Note --</font> We do not have a Mac OS 8 or 9 system on which
to compile the latest PHYLIP versions to make Mac OS 8
and Mac OS 9 executables, so we cannot update these versions to later code.
<P>
For Macintosh Mac OS (Mac OS 8 or 9) the package is distributed as a single
Stuffit (.sit) archive of 4.9 Megabytes, which contains the source code,
documentation, and executables:

If the Mac OS machine on which you will use the package is not connected to the
Internet, you may instead prefer to download these four Stuffit archives which
are each small enough to be written onto a floppy disk:
