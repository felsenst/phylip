This directory contains some older versions of PHYLIP.  These were
in Pascal, and what you will find here is the Pascal source code and
the documentation files.  

They are in the form of Unix tar archives, which can be un-tar'ed on
any Unix server, but putting them in a directory of their own and then
issuing the command   "tar xvf phylip17.tar" (or whatever the archive
name is).

The versions you will find here are

    Version           Date of Release         Name of archive file
    -------           ---- -- -------         ---- -- ------- ----

      1.7             December, 1981            phylip17.tar
      2.2             April, 1982               phylip22.tar
      2.51            February, 1984            phylip251.tar
      2.61            December, 1984            phylip261.tar
      2.7             July, 1985                phylip27.tar
      3.0             April, 1987               phylip30.tar
      3.1             March, 1988               phylip31.tar
      3.3             June, 1990                phylip33.tar
      3.4             June, 1991                phylip34.tar

More are coming.  Version 1.7 is the earliest one that I have.  Version
1.0 was released in October, 1980.  A reading of the "bugs" file in version
1.7 will show that only a few bug fixes and minor features separate
versions 1.0 and 1.7.

Version 3.5c is available through the PHYLIP web site for download of files
from the page on old versions of PHYLIP.

These programs are, of course, primitive compared to later programs.
They are presented here primarily for their historical interest.
