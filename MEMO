USING GIT


To use git here:

To clone a git repository to here

git clone https://github.com/felsenst/phylip/ .


To put some changed files up on the github master copy of "phylip"
after changing local stuff (which seems by default to be branch "master")
by "git commit filename"

git push https://felsenst@github.com/felsenst/phylip/ master

to merge with master branch on github.  This is of form
git push remote master
where "remote" is a location like 
 http://felsenst@github.com/felsenst/phylip/ 
This tries to merge files at github with those recently modified locally

When it asks for username use "felsenst"
When it asks for password, usual with 2


To bring recent changes that were put on  github.com  down to this 
local machine when they were changed on another machine and already 
pushed up,

  git pull http://felsenst@github.com/felsenst/phylip master

note also:
    git config --global user.name "Joe Felsenstein"
    git config --global user.email joe@gs.washington.edu


also: to diff with the remote master copy:
  git diff    (?)

WHAT'S BEING WORKED ON

Working on:
   dnapars.c   Fixing forknode machinery with save/load of saved trees,
         also in initialization of trees
   Treedist.c:  put in a non-verbose FULL_MATRIX option for computer-reading.  See cons.h too
For contrast:
   When ML sizes inferred, write out in outfile whether 21st character for size
      is added to analysis
   When Procrustes size inference is made, do *not* write out that size is
      inferred by ML versus linear -- it's Procrustes size that is used

For contml    currently  generic_tree_get_forknode
               fails to assign a correct "index" to the forknode.
               Should this be done in  contml.c, in ml.c, in phylip.c ?
