To use git here:

git push https://github.com/felsenst/phylip/ master


after changing local stuff (which seems by default to be branch "master")
do  "git commit filename" on it.  Then to merge with master branch on
github do
git push remote master
where "remote" is a location like "https://github.com/felsenst/phylip/"
This tries to merge files at github with those locally

Not sure how one uses

  git pull remote origin master

note also:
    git config --global user.name "Joe Felsenstein"
    git config --global user.email joe@gs.washington.edu


Working on:
   dnapars.c   Fixing forknode machinery with save/load of saved trees,
         also in initialization of trees
   Treedist.c:  put in a non-verbose FULL_MATRIX option for computer-reading.  See cons.h too
For contrast:
   When ML sizes inferred, write out in outfile whether 21st character for size
      is added to analysis
   When Procrustes size inference is made, do *not* write out that size is
      inferred by ML versus linear -- it's Procrustes size that is used

For contml    currently  generic_tree_get_forknode
               fails to assign a correct "index" to the forknode.
               Should this be done in  contml.c, in ml.c, in phylip.c ?
