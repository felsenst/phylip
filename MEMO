USING GIT


To use git here:

To clone a git repository to here

git clone https://github.com/felsenst/phylip/ .

--------------------------------------------------------

To change current branch of the git repository to foobar:

git checkout foobar

(this does not seem to move files, just to change which branch you
are talking about)

--------------------------------------------------------

To make the content of one branch (say "master") be replaced by
the content of another (say "gh-pages"):

git checkout master
git merge gh-pages

(So you're "in" master, and merging from that other
 branch.  This is all on the local version of those)

--------------------------------------------------------

To put some changed files up on the github master copy of "phylip"
after changing local stuff (which seems by default to be branch "master")
by "git commit filename" or more generally  "git commit filename1 filename2"
(It will ask you then to edit the first line of a file
that describes the commit.  Be obedient and do that).

Use:

git push https://felsenst@github.com/felsenst/phylip/ master

to merge with master branch on github.  This is of form
git push remote master
where "remote" is a location like 
 http://felsenst@github.com/felsenst/phylip/ 
This tries to merge files at github with those recently modified locally

When it asks for username use "felsenst"
When it asks for password, usual with 2

--------------------------------------------------------

To bring recent changes that were put on  github.com  down to this 
local machine when they were changed on another machine and already 
pushed up,

  git pull http://felsenst@github.com/felsenst/phylip master

--------------------------------------------------------

note also:
    git config --global user.name "Joe Felsenstein"
    git config --global user.email joe@gs.washington.edu

--------------------------------------------------------

also: to diff of your local changes with the files you
pulled down to the local system
  git diff
to focus on the .c or .h  files that matter, use
  git diff | grep diff

--------------------------------------------------------

if remote and local branches get out of synch and cannot
use ordinary commits to resolve this, pull down the
remote branch with
    git fetch https://felsenst@github.com/felsenst/phylip master
and then do a 
    git commit 
(with no list of files)
and then do a push to the remote, as above

... or look at the local file that had >>> and <<<
indicating the diff, edit it to correctness, and
then do a 
    git commit
(with no list of files)
and then do a push to the remote, as above

WHAT'S BEING WORKED ON

Working on:
   dnapars.c   Fixing forknode machinery with save/load of saved trees,
         also in initialization of trees
   Treedist.c:  put in a non-verbose FULL_MATRIX option for computer-reading.  See cons.h too
For contrast:
   When ML sizes inferred, write out in outfile whether 21st character for size
      is added to analysis
   When Procrustes size inference is made, do *not* write out that size is
      inferred by ML versus linear -- it's Procrustes size that is used

For contml    currently  generic_tree_get_forknode
               fails to assign a correct "index" to the forknode.
               Should this be done in  contml.c, in ml.c, in phylip.c ?
