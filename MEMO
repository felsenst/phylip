To use git here:

git pull remote origin master
git push remote origin master   (?)

note also:
    git config --global user.name "Joe Felsenstein"
    git config --global user.email joe@gs.washington.edu

how to use  "git commit" with these?


Working on:
   dnapars.c   Fixing forknode machinery with save/load of saved trees,
         also in initialization of trees
   Treedist.c:  put in a non-verbose FULL_MATRIX option for computer-reading.  See cons.h too
For contrast:
   When ML sizes inferred, write out in outfile whether 21st character for size
      is added to analysis
   When Procrustes size inference is made, do *not* write out that size is
      inferred by ML versus linear -- it's Procrustes size that is used

For contml    currently  generic_tree_get_forknode
               fails to assign a correct "index" to the forknode.
               Should this be done in  contml.c, in ml.c, in phylip.c ?
