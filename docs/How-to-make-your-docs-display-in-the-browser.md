# How to Make These Docs Display in the Browser

## How to Make These Docs Display as GitHub Pages

Suppose, for illustration, your GitHub username is `felsenst`,
so this repository is on GitHub at `https://github.com/felsenst/phylip`.
(Substitute your _real_ GitHub username, in what follows.)

1. Create the GitHub repository `https://github.com/felsenst/felsenst.github.io` . This is a dummy repository with nothing in it. GitHub requires this.
No, I don't know why.

1. Browse to `https://github.com/felsenst/phylip` -> Settings -> Pages

1. Under Source, Branch -> `master`, Folder -> `/docs`

1. Save

Your should now be able to see your documentation at `https://felsenst.github.io/phylip`

Sometimes after the last step, GitHub takes a minute or two and you'll need to follow with a `<SHIFT><Refresh>` in your browser,
but after that you should be good to go.

Everyone else who can see your repo should also be able to see your docs at that same URL.
