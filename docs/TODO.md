# TODOs and Questions

* `codml.html` and `javainterfaces.html` are missing from index.html . Do they belong in it? If not, where do they belong?

* Could `documentation file` be deleted from every line of the index web page?
For me (jsh), they're redundant, and clutter it up.

* The blue bird in the logo (phylip.gif) looks a lot like Twitter's.
Could changing the color and/or shape save a lawsuit?
